# react-native-shuffle
Smart Shuffleboard mobile client

To get react native setup, follow [this link](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#content).

Follow instructions there for building/serving the app as well. 

You should use npm3, if not you will have some build issues (fbjs and react will conflict with react-native's fbjs and react dependencies)
